# Learning-github
Learning github and all its features through a LinkedIn course by Ray Villalobos. I also learned how to use git through the terminal using my local machine, and that github is a way to bring all of your code to the cloud, which has an array of benefits. This course will teach me how to understand and better use github in order to keep my code safe.
